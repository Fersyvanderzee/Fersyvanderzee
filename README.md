HI! NICE TO MEET YOU!
My name is Fersy van der Zee. I am a creator and life long learner and I use Github to display my code and the projects I carried out.
Some of them are just for fun or to learn something new, others have a more serious approach.

I love learning new stuff. Which can range from using new software to offline projects like writing songs.
I live by the idea that you can learn everything you can put your mind to. Everything is figureoutable, so to say!

My main programming languages are Python for data analysis and automation and C# combined with Unity for games. Recently I dove into Java to gain more understanding of OO programming.

Anyway, take a look around! If you see something you like and want to know more about or just want to get in touch with me, hit me up!
