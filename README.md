HI! NICE TO MEET YOU!
My name is Fersy van der Zee. I am a creator and life long learner and I use Github to display my code and the projects I carried out.
Some of them are just for fun or to learn something new, others have a more serious approach.

I love learning new stuff. Which can range from using new software to offline projects like writing songs.
I live by the idea that you can learn everything you can put your mind to. Everything is figureoutable, so to say!

Anyway, take a look around! If you see something you like and want to know more about or just want to get in touch with me, hit me up!
